## Lab Question Answers

Answer for Question 1: 
RESTful APIs are scalable because APIs built with the REST architecture optimizes interactions between the client and the server. An example of this is that a RESTful API is stateless, so the server does not have to keep track of past requests since processesing current requests is not dependent on past ones.

Answer for Question 2:
The resources that the mail server is providing to its clients is the "mail" which is formatted as a json file.

Answer for Question 3:
A common REST Method not used in our mail server is cacheability. The server could be extended to use this method by caching the mail on the client side so that not every mail has to be accessed everytime something updates.

Answer for Question 4:
API keys are used for many RESTful APIs because it authenticates and authroizes users. They first authenticates a user to see who they are. It then authorizes their requests for the information they are allowed to have. By doing so, it makes sure information is given only to those who are supposed to access it.
